## Introduction

This is a sample Jenkins plugin project to show the Maven configuration for releasing to the ToolSpring Plugin Center, a private Maven repository. The plugin is a skeleton: example Jenkins build step, generated by Maven Archetype plugin.

The files and directory structure are based on boilerplate generated by Maven Archetype plugin using the command below:

```Shell
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=io.jenkins.archetypes:
```

## Getting started

The Maven `release:perform` goal requires your ToolSpring credentials for authenticating to the ToolSpring Plugin Center. Your ToolSpring username and password should be accessible in a Maven parameters file, usually in one of the locations tabled below:

| Operating System | Path |
| - | - |
| Linux | ~/.m2/settings.xml |
| Windows | %USER_PROFILE%\\.m2\\settings.xml |

**Important:**

Secrets like your ToolSpring login credentials should not normally be stored in a version control repository.

Edit the file **pom.xml** to customize the configuration for your Jenkins plugin. Then execute the command below to build and release your plugin.

| Operating System/Console | Command |
| - | - |
| Linux | mvn --batch-mode release:prepare release:perform |
| Windows PowerShell | .\\\mvn --batch-mode release:prepare release:perform |
| Windows Command Prompt | mvn --batch-mode release:prepare release:perform |
